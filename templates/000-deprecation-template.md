# <RFC title>

## Summary

> One paragraph explanation of the deprecation.

## Motivation

> Why are we doing this? What are the problems with the deprecated feature? What is the replacement functionality?

## Transition Path

> This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the use-cases that deprecated functionality covers, and for each use-case, describe the transition path.
> Describe it in enough detail for someone who uses the deprecated functionality to understand, for someone to write the deprecation guide, and for someone familiar with the implementation to implement.

## How We Communicate This

> Would the acceptance of this proposal mean the Amundsen documentation must be re-organized or altered?
> Does it change how Amundsen user's are onboarded? Does it mean we need to put effort into highlighting the replacement functionality more?
> How should this deprecation be introduced and explained to existing Amundsen users?

## Drawbacks

> Why should we _not_ do this?

> Please consider:
> The impact on onboarding and learning about Amundsen
> Integration of this feature with other existing and planned features
> Deprecation cost, both in term of code size and complexity
> If there are tradeoffs to choosing any path. Attempt to identify them here.

## Alternatives

> What other paths have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
> What is the impact of not doing this?

## Unresolved questions

> What parts of this RFC are TBD?

## Future possibilities

> What kind of possibilities does this deprecation open for the project?
