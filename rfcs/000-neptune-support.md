#  Amazon Neptune Databuilder Support

## Summary

This RFC proposes introducing support for Amazon's GraphDB Neptune. 

## Motivation

Currently as of now Amundsen only supports Neptune in the metadata proxy. This RFC proposes to add Neptune support to the databuilder so that Amundsen fully supports Neptune throughout its stack.  

## Guide-level Explanation (aka Product Details)

Currently the Amundsen databuilder library only has support for the Neo4j datastore. The goal of this rfc is to add additional loaders, publishers, and serializers to the library suite so that Neptune is supported. The goal is to maintain the same interfaces so that the switching between neo4j and neptune is as easy as switching the components. 

## UI/UX-level Explanation

Not Applicable

## Reference-level Explanation (aka Technical Details)

To support neptune in the databuilder. Serveral new components are needed: 

- A neptune serializer which converts `GraphNodes` and `GraphRelationships` into the format that the Neptune's bulk data loader expects. 

- A `FsNeputuneCSVLoader` similar to the `FsNeo4jCSVLoader` which writes the GraphNodes and GraphRelationships into csv's that can be consumed by the publisher. 

- A `NeputuneCsvBulkPublisher` which takes the csv's generated by the `FsNeputuneCSVLoader` and publishes them to Neptune. The process of publishing can be broken down into 2 steps. 
  1. Uploading the CSV files to Amazon's S3.
  2. Making a request to the Neptune's bulk loader endpoint pointing at the s3 files. (details can be found https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/bulk-load.html)
Thanks to the team at Square most of the process of publishing amundsen data to Neptune is already implemented in the neptune bulk loader api found in the repo https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsengremlin.

- Adding the amundsengremlin repo as a dependency. 

- Tests supporting Neptune models and loader and publisher. 

## Drawbacks

The rfc adds support for another datastore which brings in additonal components and increases the code size of the repo. In addition the https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsengremlin repo will be brought added as a dependency which brings in its complexities as well. 


## Alternatives

No action is the main alternative here. The dependencies from https://github.com/amundsen-io/amundsengremlin could be seperated so that the metadataproxy and databuilder don't have the same requirements but it seems unnessary as of now.
